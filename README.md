## 🧠 Key Features

- 📁 **Batch Image Processing**  
  Automatically scans all images in a selected folder.

- 🧾 **Text Recognition with PaddleOCR**  
  Uses the robust and accurate PaddleOCR engine for detecting multilingual text.

- 📄 **Excel Output Format**  
  Saves all recognized content into a `.xlsx` file, organized by filename and text segments.

- 💡 **Lightweight & Easy to Use**  
  Simple to run, requires minimal setup.
